Dependency management in gradle -
    Is a technique for declaring, resolving and using dependencies required for the project.
At runtime, gradle will locate the declared dependencies if needed for operating a specific task,
the dependencies might need to be downloaded from a remote repository, retrieved from a local
repository. This process is called dependency resolution. Modules can provide additional metadata.
Metadata is the data that describes the module in more details: information about the repository,
its authors.

Dependency resolution -
    Gradle takes your dependency declarations and repository definitions and attempts to do download 
by a process called dependency resolution. 
    - Given a required dependency.  
    - Once each repository has been inspect for the module.
    - All of the artifacts for the module are then requested from the same repository that was
    chosen above.
